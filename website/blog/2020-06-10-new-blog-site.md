The [old website](https://old.comby.dev) started off nice and simple and kept everything about
`comby` on one page. As that grew things being unwieldly, and I wanted to
partition off the usage documentation and "other things". Another piece of
feedback was that the landing page wasn't working for some ("what is this
thing?").

So over the past couple of weeks I've been building a new site piece by piece. I
think the result gets rid of a couple of thorns and I like the refresh. I was
inspired by the [Sorbet website](https://sorbet.org/) and ended up using
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), it's cool.
